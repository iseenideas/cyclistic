# cyclistic

# **Cyclistic** is a fictional bike-share program featuring 5800+ geotracked bicycles and 600+ docking stations around Chicago. 
# Bikes may be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at anytime. 
# Although Cyclistic is fictional, the data stems from real program operated by [Divvy](https://ride.divvybikes.com/), 
# a business partner in the City of Chicago's bike sharing system.

# While most riders opt for classic bikes and ride for leisure, approximately 30% ride for daily commute to schools, 
# universities, or work. Casual riders typically buy either single-ride or full-day passes while annual members enjoy 
# unlimited rides throughout the year. Cyclistic sets itself apart by offering assistive options to about 8% of its riders.

# This repo provides insights extracted from the publicly available data on how riders use the service
# and presents recommendations for a new marketing program seeking to drive conversion of casual riders into annual members.
